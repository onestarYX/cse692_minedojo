[{"structure": "Stone Bricks Base (4 hollow layers)", "material": "stonebrick", "dimension": "Each layer has an outer dimension of 5\u00d75 blocks with a 3\u00d73 hollow interior. Height of the base is 4 blocks (y = 0 through y = 4).", "position": "Start at ground level, y = 0. For a perfectly centered build at (0, 0, 0), let the interior extend from x = -1 to x = +1 and z = -1 to z = +1, with the walls at x or z = -2 and +2. The top of this section finishes at y = 4.", "tips": "Build one layer at a time: each ring layer requires 16 stone_bricks (5\u00d75 outer, minus 3\u00d73 hole). Place all four layers directly on top of each other for 4 levels of walls. Ensure the interior remains open for future customization.", "description": "This base provides a sturdy, 4-block-tall enclosure of stone_bricks, ready for a roof or second floor. The hollow center can be used for an interior floor, windows, or doors as needed."}, {"structure": "Oak Wood Roof", "material": "log", "dimension": "A single 5\u00d75 layer that sits atop the stone_bricks base. 5 blocks wide (x-axis), 5 blocks deep (z-axis), and 1 block high (y-axis).", "position": "Start immediately above the 4th layer of stone_bricks, i.e., at y = 4.

Make sure it neatly aligns with the wall edges.", "description": "The wooden top seals the enclosure, forming a simple flat roof. It can serve as a final cap to the structure or a base for a second floor."}]
