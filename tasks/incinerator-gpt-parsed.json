[{"structure": "Wide Cylindrical/Polygonal Base", "material": "stonebrick", "dimension": "~11 blocks wide (x), ~11 blocks deep (z), 3 blocks tall (y=0 to y=3). Shape can be circular or an 8\u201312-sided polygon.", "position": "Center at (0,0). Build outward so the radius or half-width is about 5 blocks from the center. The top of this tier finishes around y=3.", "tips": "Create a circular or multi-angled outline (11-block diameter). Fill in or shape the interior as desired. Add vertical strips (buttresses) every few blocks for a ridged appearance, if matching the reference design.", "description": "This forms the heavy, fortified base. The ridged or columnar design gives a sturdy, industrial look."}, {"structure": "Slightly Narrowed Second Level", "material": "stonebrick", "dimension": "Steps inward 1 block from the lower tier\u2019s edge. Extends from y=3 to y=7 (4 blocks tall).", "position": "Start immediately above the lower tier (y=3). Inward offset means an ~9\u00d79 overall outline if the base was ~11\u00d711.", "tips": "Maintain a matching polygon or circular shape, ensuring a cohesive taper. Continue vertical detailing or columns to align with the tier below.", "description": "The body of the structure, continuing the dome-like taper. Leaves enough internal space (if hollow) for a large furnace or decorative interior."}, {"structure": "Topmost Stone Bricks Dome/Cap", "material": "stonebrick", "dimension": "Narrows again by 1 block around the perimeter, from ~9\u00d79 to ~7\u00d77. Rises from y=7 to about y=10 (3 blocks tall), with a small opening or flat area at the top center.", "position": "Built directly on top of the middle tier at y=7. Finishes around y=10, leaving a central 3\u00d73 or similar space for the chimney.", "tips": "Slope or round the edges slightly, or step them in layers for a dome-like shape. Ensure the top has a 3\u00d73 opening (or at least a suitable space) to place the chimney in the next step.", "description": "Concludes the main stone_bricks structure, forming a domed top with an opening for the chimney. The shape is reminiscent of a furnace or incinerator housing."}, {"structure": "Narrow Vertical Chimney", "material": "nether_brick", "dimension": "3\u00d73 footprint, ~3 blocks tall, from y=10 to ~y=13.", "position": "Centered atop the upper tier\u2019s opening, aligned with (0,0). Rises above the dome.", "tips": "Make sure the 3\u00d73 nether_bricks column lines up with the hole left in the dome. You can add finishing details or a slight lip at the chimney\u2019s top for style.", "description": "A dark, heat-resistant shaft that vents smoke from the incinerator below. The nether_bricks contrast sharply with the stone_bricks dome."}]
