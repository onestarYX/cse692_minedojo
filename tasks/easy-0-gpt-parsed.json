[{"structure": "Stone Bricks Square Ring Foundation", "material": "stonebrick", "dimension": "The ring encloses an 8\u00d78 footprint (width \u00d7 depth), is 1 block tall, and is hollow in the middle. In block units, it spans 8 blocks along x, 1 block along y, and 8 blocks along z.", "position": "Start at ground level y = 0. To center this ring at (0, 0, 0), place its corners so that x and z range from about -4 to +3 (8 blocks total in each horizontal direction). The top of this single layer sits at y = 1.", "tips": "Place the first row of 8 blocks for one side. When turning each corner, do not double-place the corner block. Continue along the new side with 7 additional blocks so that each corner is shared. Leave the 6\u00d76 interior empty.", "description": "This is a simple square ring of stone_bricks that can be used as a small foundation outline or a frame for further construction. The hollow center (6\u00d76) is left open for future floors, decorations, or other builds."}]
