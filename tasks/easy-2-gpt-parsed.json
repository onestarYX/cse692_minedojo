[{"structure": "Stone Bricks Enclosure (4 Layers)", "material": "stonebrick", "dimension": "Each horizontal layer is 5\u00d75 blocks on the outside, enclosing a 3\u00d73 hollow space. The walls are 4 blocks high, so the total dimension is 5 (width) \u00d7 4 (height) \u00d7 5 (depth).", "position": "Start at y = 0. For a neatly centered build, place the enclosure so that the hollow interior spans from x = -1 to x = +1 and z = -1 to z = +1, with the walls occupying x or z = -2 and +2. The top of the final layer will be at y = 4.", "tips": "Lay down the first layer (5\u00d75 ring) at ground level, making sure to leave the center 3\u00d73 empty. This requires 16 stone_bricks. Stack each subsequent layer exactly above the previous, aligning the blocks so the walls remain vertical. Each new layer also requires 16 stone_bricks. After placing all four layers, you will have a hollow 3\u00d73 interior open at both the top and bottom.", "description": "This single structure forms the walls of a compact enclosure, four blocks tall, suitable as a small fort-like perimeter or the beginnings of a tower. The one-block-thick walls surround a 3\u00d73 open space, allowing for customization of the interior or addition of a separate roof/floor later."}]
