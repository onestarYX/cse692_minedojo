[{"structure": "Stone Corners with Cobblestone Infill (Layer 1)", "material": "cobblestone", "dimension": "Covers a 7\u00d79 area (x by z), from y=0 to y=1 (1 block high).", "position": "Starting at (0,0,0). The top of this layer is at y=1.", "tips": "Outline the perimeter in stone, especially at the four corners and front edges. Fill the interior footprint with cobblestone. Leave a 2-wide gap at the front edge (z=0) for the doorway (from y=0 to y=2, once higher layers are added).", "description": "This base forms a stout rectangular pad. The corner stone blocks and front opening begin to define the bunker\u2019s shape."}, {"structure": "Tiers of Cobblestone with Stone Accents", "material": "cobblestone", "dimension": "Extends from y=1 up to ~y=5 at the apex. Each layer is 1 block high, stepping in ~1 block on each side as you go up, forming a curved profile.", "position": "Build directly on top of the foundation. The final topmost row sits at y=4 \u2192 y=5.", "tips": "For layer 2 (just above the foundation), place a ring of cobblestone about 5\u00d77 with stone corners or \u201cribs\u201d at the edges. For layer 3, reduce to ~3\u00d75, again with stone corners or highlights. Continue narrowing each layer until you form a small top row (perhaps 1\u00d73 or 1\u00d71, depending on the desired arch shape). Keep the front entrance open by not filling the blocks directly above the 2-wide gap for the doorway.", "description": "These stacked, progressively smaller layers create a half-dome or bunker roof. The stone highlights on each layer form ribs or ridges, enhancing the curved silhouette."}]
