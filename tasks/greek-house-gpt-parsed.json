The top surface ends at y = 1.", "tips": "You can make a small 2-block-wide \u201cstep\u201d at the front (centered on the x-axis) by extending the foundation forward an extra block or two. Ensure the edges extend 1 block around what will become the walls, so the foundation is slightly larger than the enclosed interior.", "description": "This raised platform provides the temple\u2019s base, giving it a grander, elevated look.
