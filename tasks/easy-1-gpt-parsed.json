[{"structure": "Irregular Stone Bricks Ring", "material": "stonebrick", "dimension": "Spans ~4 blocks along the x-axis and 4 along the z-axis; stands 1 block in height. Encloses an interior of about 2\u00d72 blocks in the center.", "position": "Start at ground level (y = 0). To center it around (0, 0, 0), you can position the ring so its corners range from about x = -2 to x = +1 and z = -2 to z = +1. The top of this layer finishes at y = 1.", "tips": "Place a diagonal corner block, then fill 2 blocks along the edge, then place the next corner block. Continue this pattern all the way around so that each \u201cside\u201d of the ring has 2 blocks between diagonally offset corners. Ensure the interior remains hollow (2\u00d72).", "description": "This is a simple square ring of stone_bricks that can be used as a small foundation outline or a frame for further construction. The hollow center (6\u00d76) is left open for future floors, decorations, or other builds.This ring has four short sides, each joined by a single diagonal corner block. The resulting shape is slightly octagonal. It can serve as a decorative foundation, a planter border, or a base outline for a small structure."}]
