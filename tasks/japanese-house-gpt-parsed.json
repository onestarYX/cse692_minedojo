[{"structure": "Front Step + Wooden Porch", "material": "cobblestone", "dimension": "Porch: ~7 blocks wide (x) \u00d7 2 blocks deep (z) \u00d7 1 block high (y). Step: 1\u20132 cobblestone blocks at the front center, from ground level (y=0) up to porch level (y=1).", "position": "Center the porch on the house\u2019s front side, with x ranging from -3 to +3 and z = 0 or 1 (if you choose the front edge at z=1). The top surface of the porch sits at y=1.", "tips": "Place a row of oak_planks across the full 7-block width. Extend oak_planks 2 blocks outward (z-direction) for a comfortable front deck. Put a short cobblestone step (1 block tall) at the center front, aligned with the door position.", "description": "This raised porch is the entry platform, giving the build a welcoming, rustic feel. The small cobblestone step helps bridge the ground to the deck."}, {"structure": "Lower Wall Frame and White Infill", "material": ["planks", "quartz_block"], "dimension": "Overall 7\u00d77 footprint continues behind the porch. The wall height is 3 blocks (from y=1 to y=4).", "position": "Build directly behind and above the porch, starting at y=1. Extend walls around the perimeter, leaving a 5\u00d75 interior if the walls are 1 block thick.", "tips": "Outline the corners and edges with spruce_planks \u201cbeams.\u201d Fill the spaces between beams with quartz_block. If you want windows or a doorway, leave 1\u00d72 or 2\u00d72 openings.", "description": "This step creates the sturdy, half-timber style ground floor. The white quartz_block panels contrast with the dark spruce frame for a classic cottage look."}, {"structure": "Small Upper Wall Section", "material": ["planks", "quartz_block"], "dimension": "Narrower upper portion that sits at y=4 through y=5, usually centered on the front/back. Possibly 1\u20132 blocks inset from the lower floor\u2019s perimeter (if you want a slight overhang).", "position": "Placed above the lower walls, from y=4 to about y=5. The front face might protrude to align with the roof\u2019s gable.", "tips": "Build a short \u201csecond floor\u201d or attic front with spruce beams on the edges and quartz in the middle. Allow for a small upper window if desired (e.g., 1\u00d71 or 2\u00d71 opening). This portion helps shape the roofline and adds a second story illusion.", "description": "The partial second level or attic area gives the house a cozy, layered profile, typical of medieval or fantasy cottages."}, {"structure": "Steep Cottage Roof", "material": "nether_brick", "dimension": "Overhang covers a 7\u00d77 area plus 1-block extension on each side, for ~9\u00d79 total. Height from y=5 to ~y=8 or y=9 at the highest ridge.", "position": "Base of roof sits at y=5, overlapping the top edges of the walls/attic. Slopes inward to meet at the center ridge.", "tips": "For each side, step the nether_bricks upward by 1 block as you go inward, creating a symmetrical A-frame. Extend the roof 1 block beyond the walls on the left/right sides for an authentic overhang. The front portion has a gable that frames the attic window.", "description": "The dark nether_bricks roof contrasts strongly with the lighter walls. Its steep pitch fits medieval or rustic themes, and a small front gable gives character."}]
